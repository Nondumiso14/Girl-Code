        <h1>About Me <i class="fas fa-user"></i></h1>
        <p> Hi, I am an aspiring developer with a National Diploma in Biotechnology from Tshwane University of Technology. My journey into tech was driven by deep curiosity about how technology works and a passion for solving real-world problems.

        With a background in science, I bring a strong analytical mindset, attention to details, and a structured thinking-skills that translate seamlessly into software development. I am particularly interested in how technology can enhance scientific research, healthcare, and data-driven decision-making.

        As I transition into the the tech space, I am actively building my skills in web development, problem-solving, and software design. I also bring valuable soft skills such as team collaboration, effective communication, and critical thinking -all developed through both academic and professional experiences in biotech.

        I am excited to contribute to project that make a difference, and I look forward to combining my biotech knowledge with technology to build meaningful solutions.</p>
   
        <p>Outside of technology, I love doing hands-on creative activities. One of my favorite hobbies is <strong>sewing</strong>. I enjoy designing and stitching garments, and it helps me stay creative in both tech and life!</p>
