            Thembalethu Development continues to transform the lives of Alexandra youth through skills development programmes.

            Many participants started their journey in the Social Employment Fund (SEF),  two-year programme designed to prepare them for formal jobs, further studies, or starting their businesses.</p>

        <div class="coloum"> 
           <p> to the development project coordinator at Thembalethu Muhammed Gadimang, the programme serves as a further investment in the development of youn
    
            g people in Alexandra.</p>

            <p>

            The ultimate goal of SEF is to create a clear career path for participants. The goal is to try to address the issue of unemployment, and create skills so people can go out and look for job opportunities.

            Mooketsi Mabuye, a participant in the Bank Seta initiative, said the SEF programme had empowered her. “This programme helped me because I was able to do my beauty course. I am a qualified beauty therapist. 
            
            I was able to go to school with the stipend they gave me.”</p>

            Another participant, Dyondzani Mashaba said, “When you are in this programme, they give you a chance to get any training you want… Now I have three certificates since I started.”

            Gadimang said Thembalethu did not stop at skills development, it also provided equipment to its graduates. 

            In Mabuye's case, the organisation provided her with a table to do her clients'nails.
